# PhotoGallery

Photo Gallery is a app which looks for images in Flickr and downloads and represents them to the user, also a search bar is present
to search for photos.

This app created with the help of the book "Big nerd ranch guide", helped me learn how REST API and HTTP GET request's work,
how to use JSON to get data and present it to the user, the use of libraries which help us write clean code and robust solutions such as
(volley, Gson, Picasso). 
The app also uses Job Service API(or Alarm) to create a task which has to be invoked at a particular time(or a time schedule),
Post notificiations for getting information that the task performed by the app has been done (eg. looking for new images on Flickr).
I also learn about Broadcast Receivers( particularly to know when the device has completed a boot up sequence).
